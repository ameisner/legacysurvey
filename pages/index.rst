   <h1>The DECam Legacy Survey</h1>


.. container:: col-md-6 col-left

   The Legacy Survey is producing an inference model catalog of the sky
   from a set of optical and infrared imaging data.
   14,000 square degrees of extragalactic sky
   visible from the northern hemisphere in three optical bands (g,r,z)
   and four infrared bands.
   The sky coverage is approximately bounded by -18 < Dec < +84 deg
   in celestial coordinates and abs(b) > 18 deg in Galactic coordinates.
   The DECam Legacy Survey is providing these data in the equatorial
   region at Dec < +30 deg using the Dark Energy Camera on the Blanco Telescope.
